Farmer
Welcome to the tutorial.
Lets see how your legs are moving.
Use A to turn left, use D to turn right, use W to go forward, and use S to go backward.
As you have already seen, use F to interact with things in the world.
Go to the glowing orb and interact with it, i've never been able to reach it maybe you can.
Go to the jump pad and press space on it to jump to get there.

Glowing Orb
Hello mortal.
Use the left click to attack things and use the right click to defend your self from attacks.
Now do my bidding and attack the weakling farmer.

Oh hello, traveler.
I have lost an item of great value to me.
I have lost my hoe, and without it I cannot make a living.
When I last remembered, I was on an island about to take a relaxing swim.
The farm would be barron without it.
Can you please look around and tell me where it is?
#
Oh wow, you found the darn thing. 
I always lose this old gal.
Thanks for getting it back for me.
Here is your reward, I hope it is enough

Hi friend!
I have been noticing that my crops are being destroyed by some rowdy cave people.
Can you go take care of it and knock some sense into them?
#
Woah man, I said knock some sense into them, not kill them.
What if they had lives and families?
I suppose you did fulfill my request though.
Here is your reward, I hope it is enough.

Hi, mister.
My mommy has been telling me stories about lands that have not been explored yet.
I hear stories that there are 4 islands that you can get to from here.
I could never explore them because mommy won't let me outside the village.
Golly mister, can you go explore them and tell me about it some day?
I hear there is a cool sword out there somewhere.
